# Hello-World
They asked me to do it in the guide, so why not.
They also asked me to create a branch, make some changes and then commit them. Fine. 
Oh, also asked me to write something about me. I've never coded. Here to learn, not to change the world....yet.
What about my name? I don't know, it sounds funny.
